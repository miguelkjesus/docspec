# POC, MVP & Roadmap Checklist

This document defines **hard boundaries** between:
- Proof of Concept (POC)
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Future considerations

Its purpose is to prevent scope creep, over‑engineering, and premature optimisation.

If something does not clearly belong to the current phase, it **does not ship**.

---

## Proof of Concept (POC)

### Purpose

The POC exists to answer one question:

> *Is this idea real, and does the authoring model feel good in practice?*

The POC is not about adoption, polish, performance, or extensibility.

The POC is allowed to be throwaway code.

---

### POC Success Criteria (Strict)

The POC is complete **only if all items below are true**.

#### Authoring
- [ ] `document(target, …)` exists
- [ ] `method(name, …)` exists
- [ ] `property(name, …)` exists
- [ ] Builder callback pattern works (`d => {}`)
- [ ] String shorthand works (`method("foo", "description")`)
- [ ] Multiline string descriptions are normalised (indent + trim)

#### Content primitives
- [ ] `text()`
- [ ] `param(name, description)`
- [ ] `returns(description)`
- [ ] `example(string)` (single language, text only)

#### Type safety
- [ ] Method names are type‑checked against the target
- [ ] Properties and methods are not interchangeable

#### Output
- [ ] Docs compile into a single `doc.json`
- [ ] Output reflects authoring order
- [ ] Output is deterministic

#### Usage proof
- [ ] A small example (`Cat`) is documented using the system
- [ ] No special cases for the example

---

### Explicitly Out of Scope for POC

If any of these appear, the POC has failed:

- React
- Static site generation
- Markdown
- Multi‑language examples
- CLI flags
- Versioning
- Validation rules
- VSCode / ESLint tooling

---

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Purpose

The MVP answers a different question:

> *Could another developer realistically use this on a real project?*

The MVP must feel stable, boring, and trustworthy.

---

### MVP Entry Criteria

The MVP can only begin **after the POC is complete and validated through self‑use**.

---

### MVP Core Requirements

#### Authoring API (Locked)
- [ ] `document`, `method`, `property` APIs are frozen
- [ ] `.static` namespace for static members
- [ ] `.todo` placeholders supported
- [ ] String shorthand supported everywhere
- [ ] Builder callbacks remain the primary mechanism

#### Content
- [ ] Plain text descriptions (default)
- [ ] Explicit Markdown via `md()` only
- [ ] Multi‑language examples
  - [ ] `ex.ts()`
  - [ ] `ex.ruby()`
  - [ ] extensible but minimal

#### Correctness
- [ ] Runtime validation for missing or mismatched symbols
- [ ] Clear error messages during build
- [ ] Warnings (not errors) for incomplete documentation

---

### MVP CLI

- [ ] `doc-lib build`
- [ ] Output directory support
- [ ] Fails loudly on fatal errors
- [ ] No config files required

---

### MVP Renderer

- [ ] Static HTML renderer shipped by default
- [ ] Clean, readable layout
- [ ] Collapsible sections
- [ ] Tabbed language examples
- [ ] No theming or plugins

---

### MVP Proof of Value (Non‑Negotiable)

- [ ] The project documents **itself** using only MVP features
- [ ] The published docs site is generated by the tool
- [ ] The docs demonstrate:
  - [ ] API reference
  - [ ] At least one conceptual page

If the project cannot document itself cleanly, the MVP is incomplete.

---

## Roadmap & Future Considerations

The roadmap is ordered by **impact on real users**, not technical interest.

Nothing here blocks MVP.

---

### Phase 1: Trust & Adoption

**Priority: High**

- CLI checks (missing docs, TODOs)
- Warning vs error modes
- Snapshot testing for docs
- Improved diagnostics

---

### Phase 2: Versioned Documentation

**Priority: Medium**

- Build docs from git tags
- `dev` docs from a branch
- Version switcher in UI
- Clear version labelling

Tags are immutable. Branches are previews.

---

### Phase 3: Tooling Ecosystem

**Priority: Medium**

- ESLint rules
- JSDoc → DSL migration tool
- VSCode extension (navigation + previews)

---

### Phase 4: Rendering & UX Enhancements

**Priority: Low**

- Theming support
- Search
- Diff views between versions
- Custom renderer API

---

### Phase 5: Advanced Authoring (Opt‑in)

**Priority: Low / Experimental**

- JSX authoring frontend
- MDX‑style pages
- Interactive examples

These must never become defaults.

---

## Non‑Goals (Permanent)

The following are intentionally excluded:

- Replacing JSDoc entirely
- Runtime documentation rendering
- Implicit Markdown parsing
- Retroactive mutation of versioned docs
- Becoming a general CMS

---

## Final Rule

When unsure whether something belongs in the current phase:

> **If it does not make the authoring experience simpler or the output more trustworthy, it waits.**

This rule overrides all others.
